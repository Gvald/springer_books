Downloads the free books from Springer onto your computer.

Their server is slow and some of these books are really huge.
If the scraper seems to be taking a long time, there is nothing
that I can do about this. It likely isn't stuck, but is busy downloading
the pdf. Please be patient. And you will likely want to allow this to run
over night. There are over 400 free books!
